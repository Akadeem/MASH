## Usage
To run the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open R and set your working directory to the cloned repository.
3. Run the script `MASH model.v1.0.R`.

The script will print out the total Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE) losses among males, females, and the total population. These results will be displayed in the console.

The script will also generate several plots and save them as PDF and TIFF files. The PDF file `my_plots.pdf` will contain all the plots and can be found in the `MASH/www/` directory. Individual plots will be saved as separate TIFF files in the `MASH/www/` directory.
